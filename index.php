            <p>We are pleased to announce the <i><b>4th International Conference on Infectious Diseases and Nanomedicine-2023</b></i> (ICIDN-2025), taking place from <b>December 15-18, 2025</b>, in Kathmandu, Nepal. Our previous conferences—ICIDN-2012, ICIDN-2015, and ICIDN-2021—have successfully gathered over 200 participants from more than 20 countries worldwide. The theme of ICIDN-2023 is: <i><b>"Interdisciplinary Collaborative Education for Research and Innovation in Biomedical Sciences."</b></i></p>

            <p>The primary objective of this conference is to provide a unique global platform for presentations and discussions on recent trends, challenges, and solutions in infectious diseases and nanomedicine. Additionally, it aims to strengthen scientific ties and foster networks between biomedical scientists from the Asian region and the rest of the world, promoting a systematic understanding of infectious diseases and advancing the application of nanomedicine for the betterment of humankind.</p>

            <p>ICIDN-2025 will focus on the conventional molecular microbiology, cutting-edge multi-omics technology (e.g., microbiomics, metabolomics), and potential applications of nanotechnology in infectious disease diagnosis and treatment. As with our previous editions, emerging infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance, drug design and drug delivery will be an integral part of the ICIDN-2025. The ICIDN-2023 is expected to further strengthen our mission to promote interdisciplinary education and researches in the field of microbiology, material sciences and nanotechnology in Nepal and beyond</p>

            <p>On behalf of the organizing committee, we extend our warm invitation to all researchers, students, faculties, healthcare professionals, policy makers, and members from industry to attend and contribute to ICIDN-2023. Please plan to join us in Kathamndu during mid-December.</p>

            <p>We eagerly look forward to welcoming you to ICIDN-2025.</p>

            <p>Sincerely,<br/>
            <b>Prof. Rameshwar Adhikari (Convener)</b> and <b>Dr. Santosh Thapa (Co-Convener)</b><br/>
